Finaly the stability release is comming up. I tried a lot to increase the wifi stability. I hop this issue is now fixed.
Further some smaler tasks where approached:
* fixed some OLED issue,
* some messages which sould not forwared to the APRS-IS servers are now ignored,
* and the iGate is using now the qAR instead of qAS.

Here you can download the new [release](https://github.com/lora-aprs/LoRa_APRS_iGate).
