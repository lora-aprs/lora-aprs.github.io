We are a group of amateur radio operators who would like to bring APRS via LoRa to OM's. Try it out, participate in the development of new iGates, trackers or write a documentation for a software/firmware. We always need more help!

Would you like to develop something completely new? Get in touch with us, we can help you.

You can find more information in our <a href="https://github.com/lora-aprs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitHub</a> repositories and on our documentation page.
